I always pictured myself as a bit of a loner scientist. However, a spark was ignited within after volunteering at my local elementary school. Through tutoring and volunteering, that I found that I receive great satisfaction at educating young minds. Teaching, and learning, has become a passion of mine, and with a Bachelor's of Science in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from Georgia Institute of Technology, I have so much knowledge to pass on to, and provide inspiration for, our future generations. 

Because of my background in science, I also found a niche in big data. I love working with programming languages such as Python to sift through and visualize the massive datasets that many experiments produce, like the massive amount of data collected by LIGO while searching for gravitational waves. I enjoy programming both Front-end web development and Back-end API programming. The Front-end incorporates my creativity to create user-friendly environments through responsive design principles and the Back-end allows me to flex my problem solving and critical thinking skills. 

I enjoy finding and quickly learning new skills and programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C, C++, C#, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, PHP, MySQL, jQuery, Bootstrap, Django, Flask, Matlab, Mathematica, Unity, and Git/GitHub. I am currently learning about Node.JS, React, and Express.JS. I have also recently started a very interesting journey into the world of information security and bug bounty hunting. Scouring the web for new programming languages or new tips or tricks for those I already know is my hobby and each one I find is another tool in my ever expanding toolbelt. With this expanding toolbelt, I am now able to start to look at how security puzzles itself into the elaborate collage of the world wide web.

As is evident, I am a person of many hats. So, I'll end this little biography as I started it, with a quote; a quote that describes both my practical modis operandi and my overall philosophy:

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
